Flappy Bird Clone in Java 🐦
A classic Flappy Bird game recreated using Java and the Swing library. This project is a simple and fun demonstration of 2D game development principles, including real-time rendering, user input handling, and collision detection.

🌟 Features
Classic Gameplay: Experience the original, addictive Flappy Bird mechanics.

Dynamic Obstacles: Pipes are generated at random heights to keep you on your toes.

Score Tracking: Your score increases for every pair of pipes you successfully pass.

Game Over & Restart: The game ends on collision, but you can instantly restart by pressing the spacebar.

Simple Controls: All you need is the spacebar to play!

🛠️ Technologies Used
This project is built with:

Java: The core programming language used for the game logic.

Java Swing: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) and rendering the game elements.

🚀 Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Oracle website or use an open-source alternative like OpenJDK.

🎮 How to Play
Press the Spacebar to make the bird jump.

Navigate the bird through the gaps in the pipes to score points.
