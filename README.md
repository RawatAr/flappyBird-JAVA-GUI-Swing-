Right, GitHub’s Markdown renderer doesn’t always keep the same spacing, emoji sizing, or table layout as here in chat.
To make sure it appears **exactly** as intended on your repo page, we can:

1. Stick to plain GitHub-friendly Markdown.
2. Avoid relying too much on emoji or special characters for layout.
3. Use proper heading levels, bullet points, and tables that GitHub’s parser handles well.
4. Add badges at the top for a professional look.

Here’s a **GitHub-optimized final README** that will render cleanly there:

If you paste **this exact Markdown** into your `README.md` file, it will render cleanly and consistently on GitHub without spacing or layout issues.  

If you want, I can also add **professional badges** (Java version, license, repo size, stars, forks) at the very top so your README pops visually. That will make it more appealing at first glance. Would you like me to add those?
